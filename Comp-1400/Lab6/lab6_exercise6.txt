A)
Output:
Hi. This is case 0
Hi. This is case 1

Questions:
- Case 2 is not selected since the variable i is set to zero at the beginning and immediately
  goes to case 0 which will proceed to case 1 after all the code in case 0 is executed, and then stop
  after executing all of case 0 and 1. Afterwards the variable i would have a value of 2 meaning the condition
  in the while loop will not be met, therefore not executing case 2.

- There will be only one iteration of the while loop in part A.

B)
Output:
Hi. This is case 0
Hi. This is case 1

Questions:
- Case 2 is not selected since the variable i is set to zero at the beginning and immediately
  goes to case 0, after executing all of case 0, the loop will restart due to the break.
  i will also be updated to a value of 1, meaning it will execute case 1. Afterwards, the loop will
  be terminated after executing all of case 1, and the variable i will have an updated value of 2.
  This will make the condition in the while loop false meaning case 2 will not be selected whatsoever.

- There will be two iterations of the while loop in part A. First one will execute case 0, second one will execute case 1, and then stop.
