                <h2>Instructor: John Smith</h2>
                <h3>Course Content:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Basic syntax and control structures: Including data types, variables, expressions, and basic control structures such as if/else statements, loops, and switch statements.</li>
                    <li>- Functions and arrays: Students will learn how to create and use functions in C++, as well as how to work with arrays.</li>
                    <li>- Pointers and memory management: C++ is known for its use of pointers and manual memory management, so students would typically learn how to work with pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and deallocation.</li>
                    <li>- Object-oriented programming: C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, so students would learn the basics of OOP such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
                    <li>- File I/O: Working with files is an important part of many programming tasks, so students would learn how to open, read, and write to files in C++.</li>
                    <li>- Exception handling: Exception handling is an important part of writing robust code, so students would learn how to catch and handle exceptions in their programs.</li>
                    <li>- Multi-threading: C++ supports multi-threading, which is an important concept in modern programming. Students would learn how to use threads, mutexes, and other synchronization primitives to write concurrent programs.</li>
                    <li>- Graphics and game programming: Many students are drawn to C++ for its use in game development and other graphics-intensive applications, so they may learn how to use libraries such as OpenGL and SDL to create graphics and games.</li>
                </ul>
