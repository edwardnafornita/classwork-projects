In the results.png screen shot, one can notice that the server side of the program 
has some strange output. However, this is due to the fact that I killed the client 
process rather than the server process which resulted in this malfunction.

However, the program handles the processes just fine, this error persists when
the client process is unexpectedly exited which simply shows what would happen
when an abnormal termination is performed.
